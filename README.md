## Why does America have a history in racism
Back in early America slavery was widley looked down upon.
But when american realised that slaves were verry profitable, they started creating false claims.
They claimed that african americans were *created* by god to *work*.
These claims were absoluntaly unethical, 
but they were made for slave owneres to feel morally correct even if it meant to undermine a whole race of people.
